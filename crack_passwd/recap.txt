Let's recap: only with bruteforce, we have (approximatively)
with md5 hash:
y hacked by x in:       laptop       800$ desktop PC(CPU)       150$ GPU     10k$ bitcoin rig  4k$ ASIC

Those are not random numbers, but rather educated guesses made with calc & spreadsheet. These numbers are only there to provide
some insight about how password complexity and crack time scale and may not represent excatly how much time a (smart)
attacker may need to bruteforce your password. Just changing the first character from 'e' to '9' can make it 50x longer.
You are not safe if you password would take just a few years to crack. Valuable targets such as CEO's passwords are often
worth it, plus do not forget about the (fast) evolution of the computing market: in a few years it could take a tenth of the
previous time to crack your password. An attacker can also rent computing power on Amazon on the cheap.


Now about the dictionnary attack: 
Whatever your password, if it is in a dictionnary (some of them on the net contains millions of passwords),
your password will be found in a matter of minutes.
A combination of 2 words from the dictionnary will take bewteen days and decades to crack with mainstream hardware.
'Passphrases' are a good idea in general, but only if they cannot be guessed, proverbs and famous quotes are not secure.


Remember that my program did not support special characters, but you should really use them whenever you can.
